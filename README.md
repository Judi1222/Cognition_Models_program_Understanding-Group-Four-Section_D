# **Cognition Models for Software Program Understanding**  
**Investigating How AI Tools Transform Developer Cognition & Code Maintenance**  

## **Overview**  
This repository documents a comprehensive review of cognitive models in software engineering, focusing on how AI-assisted tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) are reshaping:  
- **Program comprehension strategies** (e.g., "beacon" recognition, hybrid human-AI workflows).  
- **Maintenance challenges** in LLM-generated code (e.g., technical debt, overconfidence).  
- **Mitigation frameworks** to balance productivity and sustainable practices.  

## **Key Studies Reviewed**  
1. **Eye-Tracking Study**: Expert vs. novice code-reading patterns.  
2. **fMRI Research**: Brain activity changes with AI assistance.  
3. **Illusion of Understanding**: Overconfidence risks with LLMs.  
4. **AI Code Maintenance**: Role of tests/docs in reducing churn.  
5. **Cognitive Load in Reviews**: Impact of AI on code review quality.  

## **Audience**  
- **Researchers** studying human-AI collaboration in software engineering.  
- **Educators** designing curricula for AI-assisted development.  
- **Developers** adopting LLM tools while preserving code quality.  

## **Repository Contents**  
- ðŸ“„ **Paper Summaries**: Key findings and mitigation strategies.  
- ðŸ“Š **Slides**: 10-slide presentation (introduction â†’ studies â†’ conclusions).  
- ðŸ—‚ **References**: IEEE-formatted citations for all reviewed works.  

## **Key Takeaways**  
> *"AI wonâ€™t replace developersâ€”but developers who master AI collaboration will replace those who donâ€™t."*  
- Hybrid workflows outperform pure AI/human approaches.  
- Tests and documentation are critical for AI-generated code.  
- New metrics are needed to assess "AI code maintainability."
